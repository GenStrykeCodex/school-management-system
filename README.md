## Versioning Strategy

This project follows incremental versioning:

| Version     | Description                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| v0.1 – v0.4 | Core CRUD Services Development |
| v0.5        | Reporting & Analytics Module   |
| v0.6        | CLI Menu Integration           |
| v1.0        | Initial Stable Release         |

## Learning Objectives

This project was built to practice:

* Python OOP principles
* Modular backend design
* Separation of concerns
* File handling with JSON
* Real-world CRUD logic
* CLI application flow control
* Git workflow and versioning

---

## Future Improvements

* Database integration (MySQL / SQLite)
